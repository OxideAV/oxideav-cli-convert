# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `-ping` flag — read only the headers of the input and print one
  IM-format line per "image" (page / video stream) to stdout, then
  exit without decoding pixels or writing any output. Output line
  shape: `<path> <FORMAT> <W>x<H> <W>x<H>+0+0 <DEPTH>-bit
  <COLORSPACE> <BYTES>B`. Multi-page PDFs emit one line per selected
  page with `[N]` suffix. Output positional becomes optional when
  `-ping` is on.
- `ping` module with a `PixelFormat` → (depth, colorspace) mapping
  table covering the common cases (8/10/12/16-bit YUV, RGB, Gray,
  CMYK, palette, mono).
- `ConvertPlan::ping: bool`.

### Fixed

- `pdf_runner::encode_bmp` updated for the new `oxideav-bmp 0.1.x`
  API (`palette: Option<BmpPalette>`, `encode_bmp` returns
  `(Vec<u8>, EncodedBmpFormat)`). Drive-by — convert had been red on
  the latest published BMP.
